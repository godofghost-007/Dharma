# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## Problem Resolved
The original deployment failed due to:
- `torch==2.1.1` incompatibility with Python 3.13.6
- Heavy ML dependencies not needed for the dashboard
- Missing Streamlit Cloud configuration files

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Requirements
**Old requirements.txt** (problematic):
- torch==2.1.1 (incompatible with Python 3.13.6)
- transformers, sentence-transformers (heavy ML libraries)
- Multiple database drivers not needed for dashboard

**New requirements.txt** (Streamlit Cloud compatible):
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
plotly>=5.17.0
aiohttp>=3.9.0
requests>=2.31.0
textblob>=0.17.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
```

### 2. Created Streamlit Cloud Files

#### streamlit_app.py
- Main entry point for Streamlit Cloud
- Imports the dashboard functionality
- Handles import errors gracefully

#### streamlit_live_dashboard.py
- Streamlit Cloud compatible dashboard
- No heavy ML dependencies
- Uses simple keyword-based threat detection
- Includes YouTube API integration

#### .streamlit/config.toml
- Dark theme configuration
- Server settings for cloud deployment

#### .streamlit/secrets.toml
- YouTube API key configuration
- Secure secrets management for cloud

#### packages.txt
- System dependencies (build-essential)

### 3. Simplified Architecture

**Removed Dependencies:**
- torch, transformers (heavy ML libraries)
- Database drivers (pymongo, asyncpg, redis, elasticsearch)
- Authentication libraries (not needed for demo)
- Monitoring and tracing libraries (overkill for demo)

**Kept Essential Features:**
- YouTube API integration
- Real-time search functionality
- Threat level analysis (keyword-based)
- Interactive dashboard with clickable results
- Sentiment analysis (simple word-based)

## Deployment Instructions

### For Streamlit Cloud:
1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set main file path to: `streamlit_app.py`
5. Deploy!

### For Local Testing:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Features Available
- Live YouTube search for anti-nationalist content
- Real-time threat detection and analysis
- Interactive dashboard with clickable results
- Threat level classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Auto-detect functionality with predefined search terms
- Expandable analysis details for each video

## API Configuration
The YouTube API key is configured in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and will work automatically on Streamlit Cloud.

## Files Modified/Created
- requirements.txt (simplified)
- streamlit_app.py (new main entry point)
- streamlit_live_dashboard.py (cloud-compatible dashboard)
- .streamlit/config.toml (theme configuration)
- .streamlit/secrets.toml (API keys)
- README.md (deployment documentation)
- STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md (this file)

The deployment should now work successfully on Streamlit Cloud!
