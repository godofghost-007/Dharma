## 📊 Service Health

The application services may take a few more minutes to fully initialize as they:
1. Connect to databases
2. Initialize AI models
3. Set up Kafka topics
4. Establish service connections

This is normal for a complex microservices architecture on first launch.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:8501
2. **Monitor System Health**: Check Grafana at http://localhost:3000
3. **Review Logs**: Use `docker compose logs -f` to monitor service startup
4. **Configure Data Sources**: Set up social media API keys in the dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If services show as unhealthy:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for full initialization
2. Check logs: `docker compose logs <service-name>`
3. Restart specific service: `docker compose restart <service-name>`
4. Full restart: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`
