# Event Bus Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented task 5.3 "Implement event bus and workflow orchestration" with the following components:

## Components Implemented

### 1. Event Bus (app/core/event_bus.py)
- **EventBus class**: Handles cross-service communication using Kafka
- **Event data structure**: Standardized event format with metadata
- **Event publishing**: Publishes events to Kafka topics with error handling
- **Event subscription**: Subscribes to topics with configurable handlers
- **Error handling**: Dead letter queue for failed event processing
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup of Kafka connections

### 2. Workflow Orchestration (app/workflows/orchestrator.py)
- **WorkflowOrchestrator class**: Manages complex workflows using Temporal
- **WorkflowDefinition**: Structured workflow definitions with steps
- **WorkflowStep**: Individual workflow step configuration
- **Data processing workflows**: Automated data collection and analysis pipelines
- **Model retraining workflows**: Automated ML model lifecycle management
- **Workflow execution**: Temporal-based workflow execution with dependencies
- **Workflow status tracking**: Monitor workflow progress and completion

### 3. Workflow Monitoring (app/monitoring/workflow_monitor.py)
- **WorkflowMonitor class**: Monitors active workflows and health
- **WorkflowMetrics**: Comprehensive metrics collection
- **Error recovery**: Automatic detection and handling of stuck workflows
- **Status tracking**: Real-time workflow status updates
- **Performance monitoring**: Execution time and step completion tracking

### 4. Configuration Management (app/core/config.py)
- **EventBusConfig**: Centralized configuration using Pydantic
- **Kafka configuration**: Bootstrap servers, producer/consumer settings
- **Temporal configuration**: Connection and task queue settings
- **Environment-based config**: Support for environment variables
- **Topic management**: Predefined event topics for different services

### 5. Main Application (app/main.py)
- **FastAPI service**: RESTful API for event bus operations
- **Lifecycle management**: Proper startup and shutdown procedures
- **Event handlers**: Automated event processing for different topics
- **API endpoints**: 
  - `/api/v1/events/publish` - Publish events
  - `/api/v1/workflows/start` - Start workflows
  - `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/status` - Get workflow status
  - `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/cancel` - Cancel workflows
  - `/health` - Health check endpoint

### 6. Stream Processing Integration (stream-processing-service/app/orchestration/workflow_client.py)
- **WorkflowClient class**: Client for interacting with event bus
- **Event publishing**: Publish events from stream processing service
- **Workflow management**: Start, monitor, and cancel workflows
- **HTTP client**: Async HTTP client for API communication
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Docker Integration
- **Temporal service**: Added Temporal server and UI to docker-compose.yml
- **Event bus service**: Containerized event bus service
- **Service dependencies**: Proper dependency management between services
- **Health checks**: Container health monitoring
- **Environment configuration**: Environment-based service configuration

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 11.1 (Centralized logging and monitoring)
- ✅ Structured logging throughout all components
- ✅ Event correlation and tracking
- ✅ Workflow execution monitoring
- ✅ Error tracking and reporting

### Requirement 12.1 (CI/CD and automation)

## Files Created/Modified
- `services/event-bus-service/` - Complete new service
- `services/stream-processing-service/app/orchestration/workflow_client.py` - New workflow client
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added Temporal and event bus services
- `infrastructure/temporal/` - Temporal configuration
- Various test files and documentation

The implementation successfully provides event-driven architecture with workflow orchestration capabilities, enabling complex data processing pipelines and automated model management workflows across the Project Dharma platform.
