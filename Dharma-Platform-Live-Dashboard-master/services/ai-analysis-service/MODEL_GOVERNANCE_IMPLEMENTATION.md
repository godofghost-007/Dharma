# Model Governance and Lifecycle Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive model governance and lifecycle management system implemented for Project Dharma's AI analysis service. The implementation addresses all requirements from task 4.4 and provides a production-ready solution for managing ML models throughout their lifecycle.

## 🎯 Requirements Addressed

Based on **Requirement 14** from the Project Dharma specification:

- ✅ **14.1**: Model registry with versioning and performance metrics
- ✅ **14.2**: Automated model performance monitoring and drift detection  
- ✅ **14.3**: A/B testing framework for gradual rollout capabilities
- ✅ **14.4**: Automatic rollback to previous stable versions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The model governance system consists of four main components:

### 1. Model Registry (`ModelRegistry`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized storage and versioning of ML models
- **Features**:
  - Semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.)
  - Model metadata and performance metrics storage
  - File integrity checking with SHA256 hashes
  - Model status lifecycle (validation → staging → production → deprecated)
  - MLflow integration for experiment tracking
  - Persistent storage with JSON-based registry

### 2. A/B Testing Manager (`ABTestManager`)
- **Purpose**: Manages controlled rollouts and model comparisons
- **Features**:
  - Traffic splitting with deterministic routing
  - Statistical significance testing
  - Automated winner detection and promotion
  - Real-time result analysis
  - Configurable test duration and sample sizes

### 3. Performance Monitor (`ModelPerformanceMonitor`)
- **Purpose**: Continuous monitoring and drift detection
- **Features**:
  - Real-time prediction logging
  - Performance metrics calculation (accuracy, latency, error rates)
  - Statistical drift detection using PSI and KS tests
  - Automated alert generation
  - Historical performance tracking

### 4. Governance Service (`ModelGovernanceService`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all governance activities
- **Features**:
  - Unified API for all governance operations
  - Background monitoring tasks
  - Configuration management
  - Integration with inference pipeline

## 🔧 Key Components

### Model Registry

```python
class ModelRegistry:
    """Centralized model registry with versioning and lifecycle management."""
    
    async def register_model(self, model_type, model_path, config_path, 
                           metrics, training_data, metadata=None, 
                           tags=None, description="") -> str
    
    async def promote_model(self, version_id: str) -> bool
    async def rollback_model(self, model_type: ModelType) -> bool
    async def get_latest_model(self, model_type, status) -> ModelVersion
```

### A/B Testing Framework

```python
class ABTestManager:
    """Manages A/B testing for model deployments."""
    
    async def create_ab_test(self, model_a_version, model_b_version,
                           traffic_split=0.1, duration_hours=24) -> str
    
    async def get_model_for_request(self, model_type, request_id=None) -> str
    async def record_test_result(self, test_id, model_version, result)
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
class ModelPerformanceMonitor:
    """Monitors model performance and detects drift."""
    
    async def setup_drift_detection(self, model_version, reference_data,
                                  feature_importance, drift_threshold=0.1)
    
    async def record_prediction(self, model_version, input_data, prediction,
                              actual=None, latency_ms=None)
```

## 🚀 API Endpoints

The governance system exposes REST API endpoints for all operations:

### Model Management
- `GET /governance/models` - List models with filtering
- `POST /governance/models/register` - Register new model
- `POST /governance/models/promote` - Promote model to production
- `POST /governance/models/{model_type}/rollback` - Rollback model
- `GET /governance/models/{version_id}/validate` - Validate model for production

### A/B Testing
- `GET /governance/ab-tests` - List active A/B tests
- `POST /governance/ab-tests` - Create new A/B test
- `POST /governance/ab-tests/{test_id}/stop` - Stop A/B test

### Performance Monitoring
- `GET /governance/models/{version_id}/performance` - Get performance summary
- `POST /governance/models/{version_id}/monitoring` - Setup monitoring
- `POST /governance/inference/record` - Record inference result

### Dashboard & Health
- `GET /governance/dashboard` - Governance dashboard data
- `GET /governance/health` - Health check
- `GET /governance/config` - Current configuration

## 📊 Model Lifecycle States

Models progress through the following states:

1. **TRAINING** - Model is being trained
2. **VALIDATION** - Model is being validated (initial state after registration)
3. **STAGING** - Model is ready for testing
4. **PRODUCTION** - Model is serving live traffic
5. **DEPRECATED** - Model has been replaced
6. **FAILED** - Model has failed validation or health checks

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### 1. Model Registration and Promotion

```python
# Register new model
version_id = await governance_service.register_new_model(
    model_type=ModelType.SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS,
    model_path="models/sentiment_v2.pkl",
    config_path="configs/sentiment_v2.json",
    metrics=ModelMetrics(accuracy=0.92, precision=0.89, recall=0.94, f1_score=0.91),
    training_data=training_data,
    description="Improved sentiment model with BERT"
)

# Promote to staging
await registry.update_model_status(version_id, ModelStatus.STAGING)

# Create A/B test
test_id = await governance_service.create_ab_test(
    model_a_version=current_production_id,
    model_b_version=version_id,
    traffic_split=0.1
)

# After successful A/B test, promote to production
await governance_service.promote_model_to_production(version_id)
```

### 2. Inference with Governance

```python
# Get appropriate model for request
model_version = await governance_service.get_model_for_inference(
    ModelType.SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS,
    request_id="req_123"
)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Record result for monitoring
await governance_service.record_inference_result(
    model_version=model_version,
    input_data=input_data,
    prediction=prediction,
    actual=ground_truth,  # if available
    latency_ms=inference_time,
    request_id="req_123"
)
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerting

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- **Accuracy**: Prediction correctness when ground truth is available
- **Latency**: Inference response time (P50, P95, P99)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Failed predictions / total predictions
- **Drift Score**: Statistical measure of input distribution changes

### Alert Conditions
- Accuracy drops below threshold (default: 5% decrease)
- Latency increases significantly (default: 2x baseline)
- Error rate exceeds threshold (default: 10%)
- Drift score exceeds threshold (default: 0.1)

### Drift Detection Methods
- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**: Measures distribution shifts
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Statistical test for distribution changes
- **Chi-Square Test**: Tests for categorical feature drift

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is highly configurable through `ModelGovernanceConfig`:

```python
@dataclass
class ModelGovernanceConfig:
    # Registry settings
    registry_path: str = "models"
    mlflow_tracking_uri: str = "sqlite:///mlflow.db"
    
    # A/B testing settings
    ab_testing_enabled: bool = True
    default_traffic_split: float = 0.1
    auto_promotion_enabled: bool = True
    
    # Alert thresholds
    accuracy_drop_threshold: float = 0.05
    drift_threshold: float = 0.1
    
    # Monitoring intervals
    health_check_interval_minutes: int = 60
    performance_analysis_interval_hours: int = 2
```
